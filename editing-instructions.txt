Corrections and suggestions are welcome! Please make your edits in `README.md`, which is the master file that also drives https://khan.github.io/kotlin-for-python-developers/. Then, run `python2 split.py` in order to generate the numbered Markdown files and `kotlinlang.org.yaml`, from which the official Kotlin site will generate the "Migrating from Python" section at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials. Please include all of these changes in your pull request.
